# GPT-2 Fine-Tuning for Text Generation

This mini project demonstrates how to fine-tune a GPT-2 language model using the Hugging Face Transformers library and the Datasets library. The goal is to build a custom text generation model capable of generating coherent and creative content based on a specific dataset.

 # Project Highlights

- Fine-tunes the **GPT-2 Medium** model
- Uses Hugging Faceâ€™s `transformers`, `datasets`, and `Trainer` API
- Implements a simple training pipeline for story or text generation
- Supports saving and reloading the fine-tuned model

# Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face `transformers`
- Hugging Face `datasets`

---

# Installation

To get started, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch accelerate
